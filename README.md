## About
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The report provides an overview of the air quality in participants' home, focusing on PM₂.₅ concentration levels. Descriptive statistics (mean, minimum, and maximum) and visualizations are used to illustrate the results. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines 2021, the 24-hour mean PM₂.₅ concentration should not exceed 15 µg/m³, read more information on WHO air quality guidelines <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines" target="_blank">here</a>.

<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The hourly average ambient (outdoor) PM₂.₅ concentration levels are incorporated into the visualization of PM₂.₅ air quality in participants' home. The historical ambient (outdoor) PM₂.₅ data is sourced from the National Environmental Agency’s (NEA) API retrieved from <a href="https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_e1058d6974c877257e32048ab128ad83/view#tag/default/GET/pm25" target="_blank">data.gov.sg</a>. NEA's PM₂.₅ data is split into five regions in Singapore—North, South, East, West, and Central - with readings recorded every hour. The readings from the region where your home is located are used to represent the outdoor air quality.

Reported PM₂.₅ concentrations for home PM₂.₅ concentration are raw and uncalibrated values.
